Overview

Ross Reddit is a Ross-only social platform (auth via umich.edu) designed to strengthen community through mentorship, peer support, and shared resources. It centralizes class advice, recruiting tips, club info, and events that are currently scattered across GroupMe, Slack, and word-of-mouth.


Problem

Many Ross underclassmen only get real guidance on classes and recruiting if they happen to be connected to selective business clubs or fraternities. Key issues:

Unequal access to resources – Mentorship and “insider” tips are gated by selective clubs.

Club recruiting opacity – Timelines, application tips, and events are fragmented and informal.

Stress & uncertainty – First- and second-years often feel behind, isolated, and overwhelmed.


Solution

Ross Reddit provides a single platform for Ross students to ask questions, find mentors, discover events, and share resources.

1. Mentorship Matching

A lightweight matching layer that connects underclassmen with upperclassmen or faculty based on shared interests (consulting, finance, tech, entrepreneurship, etc.).

Each student has a profile (career interests, clubs, experience, etc.).

Underclassmen can get paired with mentors who’ve “been there” in similar paths.

Matching algorithm + intro messages/emails to make the first connection easy.

Goal: democratize mentorship beyond selective clubs.

2. Q&A Forum

A Piazza-style forum tailored to Ross.

Students can post questions about classes, recruiting, clubs, internships, etc.

Optional anonymous posting to reduce stigma around “basic” or vulnerable questions.

Tags and upvotes (e.g., #consulting, #PM, #IB, #clubs) to surface the best advice.

Room for quality control: we can experiment with “verified mentor” badges, peer mentors, or faculty answers.

3. Events & Opportunities Feed

A central place for everything happening around Ross.

Club events, coffee chats, case workshops, and app deadlines.

Reduces reliance on scattered GroupMe/Slack threads.

Helps underclassmen see what’s going on this week at a glance.

4. Resources Hub

A living library of Ross-specific knowledge.

Recruiting guides, past app responses, case prep tips, class reviews, etc.

Community-updated, so it evolves as new classes, clubs, and firms enter the mix.


Product Goals

Equity: Level the playing field for underclassmen who aren’t in selective clubs.

Clarity: Reduce uncertainty around recruiting and club timelines.

Community: Make it normal (and easy) to ask for help and share knowledge.

Sustainability: Build something future classes can maintain, expand, and improve.
